# PyInstaller spec for EasyPost Desktop.
# Build from the project root with:
#   .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m PyInstaller packaging\build_exe.spec --noconfirm
#
# Builds in --onedir mode (a folder, not a single self-extracting exe).
# Onefile builds unpack themselves into a temp directory at every launch,
# which is a strong heuristic signal antivirus/SmartScreen use to flag
# packers/droppers. Onedir avoids that runtime self-extraction, which
# meaningfully reduces false-positive flags for an unsigned build (see
# README's "Windows SmartScreen warning" section for the full picture —
# this alone does not eliminate the warning, only code signing does that).
